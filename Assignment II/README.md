# Assignment 2

## A Bale of Turtles

Modify the Turtle class so that it has a "draw()" method and a "draw(Color color)" method. The implementation of these draw methods should draw a shape of your choosing. Create three subclasses of Turtle: SpiralTurtle, ConfusedTurtle, and SmartTurtle. Override the "draw()" methods of the subclasses. The SpiralTurtle "draw()" method should draw a spiral. The ConfusedTurtle "draw()" should draw an erratic pattern of random sized segments drawn in chaotic directions. The Deitel & Deitel textbook has a section entitled "Case Study: Random-Number Generation" which demonstrates how to generate random numeric values within a given range. Your ConfusedTurtle "draw" will need to randomly choose lengths and directions to control its drawing movement. Be sure that the "draw" method has a finite number of steps to its movement. The SmartTurtle "draw()" method should draw a "design" of your own choosing.

Create a BaleOfTurtles class. This class will have a "main" method. This method will perform the following operations:

Create a "World". 
Initialize Array of three Turtles with references to a SpiralTurtle, a ConfusedTurtle, and a SmartTurtle. Be sure that these Turtles are placed with the current World.
Create a Color object representing a color of your choosing.
Iterate through your Turtle Array, and call the "draw(Color color)" using each Turtle reference within the Array.

Important!: Remove any duplicate code that you might have added.
One way of avoiding unnecessarily duplicated code (such as in a draw method), is to have one method call another method. In this manner, you can factor out the commonality. Also, please donâ€™t forget to place the new draw(Color...) method in the Turtle class as directed.


Submit the .java files of all modified classes (including the Turtle class) together as a single zipped attachment. Please use the zip format (not .rar or any other format).
