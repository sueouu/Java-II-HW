# Assignment 4

## Other-Worldly Bodies

Apply the chromakey technique in a range--grab something out of its background where the something is only in one part of the picture.  For example, put a halo around someone's head but don't mess with the rest of the body. Your “range” functionality should be parametized to support reusability.

Submit the final image file that you produced along with the .java files of all modified classes together as a single zipped attachment. Please use the zip format (not .rar or any other format).
