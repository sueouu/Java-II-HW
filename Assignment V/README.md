# Assignment 5

## Sound Studio

Add a static main method to the Sound class, and inject code into it that demonstrates the operation of the methods that you subsequently add to the Sound class, as specified below.

Add the increaseVolume method (see Program 65 within our textbook), but write it such that it uses a for-each loop.

Add a halvePosDoubleNeg method that halves the volume of positive values and doubles the volume of negative values (again, Program 65 may help you get started).

Make an audio collage. Make it at least five seconds long, and include at least two different sounds (e.g., sounds from different files). Make a copy of one of those different sounds and mirror it. Splice together the original two sounds and the modified sound to make the complete audio collage. Your program should write the collage file out to the disk.

Submit the Sound.java file, along with the sound files used and collage sound file created.  Submit these files together as a single zipped attachment. Please use the zip format (not .rar or any other format).
